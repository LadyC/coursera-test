Solution Assignment Module 4





### General Idea


Creation of a Master-Detail view pair for a resturant menu, which has different categories and each categories has different items.
The application has 3 views (or view states): home (`home`), categories list (`categories`), items list (`items`).
No attention have been paid in the styling.

### Requirements

When the user goes to `/` path in your application, a home screen should be shown. 
It just says "Welcome to our Restaurant" and contains a link to a list of categories of menu items in the restaurant. 

Clicking that link would take the user to the `/categories` view.
The categories view should list all available categories of items on the menu. 

Each listing should be a link. Clicking that link should take the user to the `/items` view.
